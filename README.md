# calculate_distances

## Purpose
calculate_distances is a simple JavaScript which can be included in any html page and calculates the average distance between any two points on the earth's surface.

## Background
Since the Earth is a geoid, calculating distances is very complex if the results have to be accurate. But for lower accuracy requirements, the Earth can be assumed to be a sphere, which greatly simplifies the calculation. The necessary formulas are described e.g. here \[1\]. Earth's mean radius is 6,371.0088 km \[2\].

## System requirements
None, except for a web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Installation
Download the repository into your desired directory:

```
cd <directory>
git clone https://github.com/ABoehlen/calculate_distances
```

From the new directory open then index.html with your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Clicking on the "Start here" link opens a new small window where the geographic coordinates of two different locations have to be given. Each location requires 4 values, namely the degree and minute value each for the longitude and the latitude.
Clicking on the button "Calculate the distance in km" the result will be given in the field below.

### Example
Bern: 7째 27' / 46째 57'

Singapore: 103째 50' / 1째 17'

The result should be: 10387 km
